# BunyipsChatapp Source Code
### Custom chat app for the MURRAY BRIDGE BUNYIPS

This is a simple chat app made for the members of the Murray Bridge Bunyips Robotics Club to use to communicate efficiently to optimise work done for FTC and other projects within the club. It'll employ the basic features used in other chatapps, as well as some custom of our own that caters towards our needs to work as efficently and as optimally as possible. 

Uses React framework for the frontend, and uses Firebase Google authentication for accounts and Firebase Firestore for message storage.
